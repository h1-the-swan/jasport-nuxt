We present a generalizable approach to visualizing scholarly influence over time, using a dynamic node-link diagram representing the citation patterns between groups of papers. We combine this approach with hierarchical clustering techniques that exploit the network structure to partition the graph into clusters representing fields and subfields. We use these methods to explore the influence that fields have had on other fields over time.},

	abstract = {Background. DCIS treated by mastectomy ensures high local control rates. There is limited data on risk for relapse and lack of clear indication for adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). We report a retrospective review on a population of DCIS patients treated with mastectomy. The objective was to identify the overall incidence of relapse, risk factors for local recurrence, and accordingly for whom adjuvant postmastectomy RT may be considered. Methods. This is an IRB-approved retrospective study on a prospective breast cancer database. From 1997 to 2007, we identified 969 patients with diagnoses of DCIS, among them 211 breasts in 207 patients were treated with mastectomy and comprise the study group. Results. With a median followup of 55 months (4.6 years) the 10-year relapse-free survival is 97\%. Two of 211 breasts (0.9\%) treated with mastectomy developed a local-regional recurrence. Both the relapses were among patients defined as having {\textless}1 mm final mastectomy margin. Conclusions. The rare local relapse after mastectomy limits our ability to reliably identify risk factors for relapse. The consideration for postmastectomy RT should be based on an individualized risk evaluating surgical technique used, presence of BRCA mutation, grade and extent of tumor, and proximity of lesion to the margin of resection.},

	abstract = {Objectives.  To evaluate the prevalence, characteristics, and correlates of chronic pain in a population of predominantly employed, alcoholic patients attending an outpatient drug and alcohol treatment program. Methods.  A pain survey was administered to 79 patients attending an outpatient drug and alcohol treatment program situated in a suburban community outside of New York City. Chronic severe pain was defined as pain that 1) had persisted for at least 6 months; and 2) was either moderate to severe in intensity or significantly interfered with daily activities. Results.  Seventy-six percent of patients experienced pain during the past week. Chronic severe pain was experienced by 29.1\% of patients. High levels of pain interference with physical and psychosocial functioning were reported by 26.1\%. Patients with chronic severe pain were more likely to have significant comorbidity, to cite physical pain as the impetus for alcohol or drug abuse, to have abused a prescription drug or used an illicit drug to treat pain during the prior 3 months, and to have used illicitly obtained opioids. Only 13\% of patients with chronic severe pain were currently receiving pain treatment and 72\% expressed interest in receiving treatment. Discussion.  Chronic severe pain was prevalent in this predominantly employed, alcoholic population attending an outpatient drug and alcohol treatment program. Pain was associated with significant functional impairment, medical and psychiatric comorbidities, and abuse behaviors. Few patients accessed adequate pain treatment. Efforts should be made to better address the pain problems in this patient population.},

	shorttitle = {{SciSight}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12668},
	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked unprecedented mobilization of scientists, already generating thousands of new papers that join a litany of previous biomedical work in related areas. This deluge of information makes it hard for researchers to keep track of their own research area, let alone explore new directions. Standard search engines are designed primarily for targeted search and are not geared for discovery or making connections that are not obvious from reading individual papers. In this paper, we present our ongoing work on SciSight, a novel framework for exploratory search of COVID-19 research. Based on formative interviews with scientists and a review of existing tools, we build and integrate two key capabilities: first, exploring interactions between biomedical facets (e.g., proteins, genes, drugs, diseases, patient characteristics); and second, discovering groups of researchers and how they are connected. We extract entities using a language model pre-trained on several biomedical information extraction tasks, and enrich them with data from the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG). To find research groups automatically, we use hierarchical clustering with overlap to allow authors, as they do, to belong to multiple groups. Finally, we introduce a novel presentation of these groups based on both topical and social affinities, allowing users to drill down from groups to papers to associations between entities, and update query suggestions on the fly with the goal of facilitating exploratory navigation. SciSight has thus far served over 10K users with over 30K page views and 13\% returning users. Preliminary user interviews with biomedical researchers suggest that SciSight complements current approaches and helps find new and relevant knowledge.},

Common methods, such as measures of citation counts, can ignore much of the nuance and multidimensionality of scholarly influence. We present an approach for generating dynamic visualizations of scholars’ careers. This approach uses an animated node-link diagram showing the citation network accumulated around the researcher over the course of the career in concert with key indicators, highlighting influence both within and across fields. We developed our design in collaboration with one funding organization—the Pew Biomedical Scholars program—but the methods are generalizable to visualizations of scholarly influence. We applied the design method to the Microsoft Academic Graph, which includes more than 120 million publications. We validate our abstractions throughout the process through collaboration with the Pew Biomedical Scholars program officers and summative evaluations with their scholars.},

However, the role of journals has been called into question because new preprint archives and academic search engines make it easier to find articles independent of the journals that publish them. Research on this issue is complicated by the deeply confounded relationship between article quality and journal reputation. We present an innovative proxy for individual article quality that is divorced from the journal's reputation or impact factor: the number of citations to preprints posted on arXiv.org. Using this measure to study three subfields of physics that were early adopters of arXiv, we show that prior estimates of the effect of journal reputation on an individual article's impact (measured by citations) are likely inflated. While we find that higher-quality preprints in these subfields are now less likely to be published in journals compared to prior years, we find little systematic evidence that the role of journal reputation on article performance has declined.},

Mathematical language varies from ﬁeld to ﬁeld but original formulae are maintained over generations (e.g., Shannon’s Entropy equation). Here we extract a common set of mathematical symbols from more than 250,000 LATEX source ﬁles in the arXiv repository. We compare the symbol distributions across di↵erent ﬁelds and calculate the jargon distance between ﬁelds. We ﬁnd a greater difference between the experimental and theoretical disciplines than within these ﬁelds. This provides a ﬁrst step at using equations as a bridge between disciplines that may not cite each other or may speak di↵erent natural languages but use a similar mathematical language.},

However, a lack of labeled ground-truth data has made it difficult to develop and evaluate these methods. We propose a framework that uses the reference lists from existing review papers as labeled data, which can then be used to train supervised classifiers, allowing for experimentation and testing of models and features at a large scale. We demonstrate our framework by training classifiers using different combinations of citation- and text-based features on 500 review papers. We use the R-Precision scores for the task of reconstructing the review papers’ reference lists as a way to evaluate and compare methods. We also extend our method, generating a novel set of articles relevant to the fields of misinformation studies and science communication. We find that our method can identify many of the most relevant papers for a literature review from a large set of candidate papers, and that our framework allows for development and testing of models and features to incrementally improve the results. The models we build are able to identify relevant papers even when starting with a very small set of seed papers. We also find that the methods can be adapted to identify previously undiscovered articles that may be relevant to a given topic.},

We explore approaches both for recommending new content and for displaying it in a manner that helps researchers to understand the work of authors who they are unfamiliar with. In studies with computer science researchers, our approach substantially improves users' abilities to do so. We develop an approach that locates commonalities and contrasts between scientists---retrieving partially similar authors, rather than aiming for strict similarity. We find this approach helps users discover authors useful for generating novel research ideas of relevance to their work, at a higher rate than a state-of-art neural model.
